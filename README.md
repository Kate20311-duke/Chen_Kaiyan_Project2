This repository contains the materials for Project 2.

The goal of this project is to clean and summarize daily air quality data from 2018–2020, and create exploratory plots.

## Notes

- Negative values for pollutant concentrations are set to 0 before calculating daily averages.
- Daily data are aggregated to monthly summaries for plotting.
- Plot 1 shows monthly mean CO and O₃ concentrations (2018–2020 combined) with 95% confidence intervals.
- Plot 2 shows monthly mean PM2.5 concentrations by year (2018, 2019, 2020).
